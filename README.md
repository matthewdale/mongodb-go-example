A simple storefront application that provides the ability for customers to purchase items and check
item availability and for admins to track item sales. It uses the "sample_supplies.sales" table from
the [Sample Supply Store Dataset](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/sample-data/sample-supplies) in
the MongoDB Atlas sample data set.
